<div class="problem">
    <h4>Problem:</h4>

    A gardener plants three maple trees, four oaks, and five birch trees in a row. He plants them in random
    order, each arrangement being equally likely. Let $\frac m n$ in lowest terms be the probability that no two
    birch trees are next to one another. Find $m+n$.

</div>

<div class="solution">
    <h4>Solution:</h4>
    <p> So you can think of placing the $5$ birch trees and the other trees with the restrictions as described
        above. Then let's take out one tree between each pair of birch trees. So you would remove $4$ trees that
        aren't birch. What you are left with is a unique arrangement of $5$ birch trees and $3$ other trees that
        is unrestricted.
    </p>
    <p>  Some birch trees might become adjacent after you remove $4$ trees. Adding a tree
        between each pair of people gives a unique arrangement of $5$ nonadjacent birch trees. This guarantees
        that there are no adjacent trees. The number of unrestricted $7$ tree arrangments is ${8\choose5} = 56$.</p>
    <p> There are ${12\choose5} = 792$ total ways to choose the trees. So the probability is $\frac{56}{792} = \frac{7}{99}$</p>
    <p> This means our answer is $7 + 99 = \boxed{106}$</p>
    <p> </p>
