# Personal Website
A simple website that hosts a mathematics focused blog, artwork, and various research papers. 

## How it's made
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jekyll

Using Jekyll as the backbone for the blog page, both the blog page and research page are coded in a minalimist fashion. The artwork page is coded using a gallery style with the art being shown all at once. 

## Lessons Learned

Probably need to implement more Javascript into the gallery page to make a scrollable artwork function, CSS by itself doesn't work. Should probably make a more workflow type homepage as well.
