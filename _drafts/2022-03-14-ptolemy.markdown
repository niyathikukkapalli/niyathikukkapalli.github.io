# Origins and Explanations of Ptolemy's Theorem

## Ptolemy's Introduction: 

Ptolemy is one of those names paired well with Aristotle, Socrates, and other Greek intellectuals. I mean someone "Ptolemy" about this joke once, but I forgot how they put it. Haha, get it? Ptolemy is known for the discovery of the geocentric model and symmertry of reflecting light. Even considering the geocentric model, he was a revolutionary that led other astronomers to consider the Universe. Notice that all these findings require signifcant knowledge of mathematics. Meaning, he was at the top in the mathematics game. 

## Scientific Cheat?: 

As with many old Greek philosphers, we don't know much about Ptolemy. He lived in Alexandria in Egypt, which is home to one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancicent World. He was suspected to be wealthy when he was younger, and lived in the court of Pella in Alxendria. In fact, The 9th century Persian astronomer Abu Ma’shar states that Ptolemy was a member of Egypt’s royal lineage. It was during 343 BCE that Ptolemy left to study with the Greek astronomer Aristotle for about three years. 

He quickly built up his repitoire with his many publications of astronomy where his most famous one is "Almagest". However there is a lot of controversy with this book. Some actually call Ptolemy a "scientific cheat". This is because the book, "Algamest", considered the geocentric model and data that was collected by previous astronomers. Some would consider this perfectly fine, but this was the time people thought the Earth was at the center of the solar system. The data Ptolemy took for granted, in fact Hipparchus's measurments, was certaintly not accurate. In fact, in the Algamest, Ptolemy stated that the data he had was "observed with upmost care". But, he didn't even check the data. This is a fallacy in science that everyone shoudl avoid. 

Still, many forgive this discrepancy in his behavior, as he contributed other findings to compensate. 

## Ptolemy's Theorem

One of those findings was Ptolemy's Theorem. He created it to facilitate his findings in the astronomy field, yet it's one of the most useful geometry theorems out there.

It's easier to see how this works in a practice problem! 

<div class = "proof">

<p> (Source: AMC 12) Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral. The side lengths of $ABCD$ are distinct integers less than $15$ such that $BC\cdot CD=AB\cdot DA$. What is the largest possible value of $BD$? </p>

<p>  I encourage you to try and solve this on your own. Hint: Use law of cosines and supplementary angles in cyclic quadrilaterals. Research these theorems if you are not familiar with them, they are both fascinating! </p>

The theorem is utilized in a variety of competitive math problems such as AMC, USAMTS, ARML, etc. Ptolemy chose to use this theorem for creating his table of chords: a table of values of the sine function. 

## Sum and Differences 

First, he needed the sum and differences of trig functions. 

## Table of Chords 

Ptolemy used Hipparchus's data, and Hipparchus's table of chords only had lengths of chords for multiples of $\frac{\pi}{24}$ radians. So obviously, he improved it. But how is a table of chords made? 

First off, a chord is a line segemnt whose end points are on a circle. Ptolemy used a circle whose diameter was $120$ units and he calculated the length of a chord whose arc length spanned $n$ degrees. $n$ ranged from $\frac{1}{2}$ to 180 degrees. Going any further than $180$ degrees would map to another angle smaller than 180 degrees. 

By creating a right triangle with the radius of the circle and half the chord, the length of the chord is given by $ 120sin(\frac{\theta}{2})$. 

The Algamest also presents how Ptolemy found the length of chords. From there he needed something to connect all the pieces. That piece was Aristarchus's inequality.
