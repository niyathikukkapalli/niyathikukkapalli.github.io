## Introduction 

## Week 1 

This was the first week attemping to readjust to everything once again like last year. Although, I already knew to be dissapointed by the dorms, and this time I came prepared with a much better fan. I highly recommend the Amazon Basics fan, especially if you are going to a summer camp or college even. It's remote controlled and it can change the plane that it blows air (not to mention it also oscillates). Overall, highly recommend. 

They require second years to attend the morning number theory lecture even though we already listened to them last year, but it's a nice refresher. I paid attention for the first couple but then I started to work on my problem sets when times got busy. Research Projects were also introduced during this week, and they basically went through all ten of them and we got to pick our top three choices. I am planning on making an article
