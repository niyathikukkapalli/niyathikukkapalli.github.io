## Introduction

With applying to 18 schools (and that's after nixing off a couple), my college application season was quite the whirlwind. I spent many essay writing sessions crying, which eventually led me to rewriting my common app essay the day before my first round of applications were due (DO NOT RECOMMEND). But, I do think the stress was worth it. I ended up getting into **Princeton, MIT, Columbia (w/ a Likely Letter), Brown, and Cornell**. As an upcoming freshman at Princeton University, this blog post is my way of closing off my senior year of highschool. 

## The Base

 Before you start writing essays, you need to first organize all of your testing data, personal information, activites, awards, etc. It's a lot to keep track of so I'll list a couple of books that I found helpful in my process.
 



For a little background about myself, if you snoop around my website you can probably figure I like math! If you want to use terminology, my "spike" was math in my applications. But don't worry--not every activity on my application was math related. I'd say about 4-5 were math related and the rest ranged from drawing in my free time to blogging! 

Not every activity has to include winning at ISEF or making a startup--literally just list whatever it is you do! Although, it is nice to have 1-2 standout activites. 

One popular example is prestigious summer camps. I myself attended The Program in Mathematics For Young Scientists (PROMYS) for two years. Others include RSI, MOP, MITES, SuMAC, Mathcamp, Ross, etc. Check out this link: <a href="https://blog.collegevine.com/most-prestigious-summer-programs-for-high-school-students">Summer Camp List</a> for a good list!


## Writing Essays

Honestly, this will probably be the chunkiest part of the blog post--the essays. So, it takes a while to figure out what the "perfect" essay should be. I only discovered some key elements after reading many many examples (and of course writing my own supplementals). The main thing I always kept in mind was
