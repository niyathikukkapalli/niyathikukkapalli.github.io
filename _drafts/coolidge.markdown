# A Review of Calvin Coolidge's Autobiography

## By: Niyathi Kukkapalli

## His Childhood 

He had a quaint childhood with some obstacles along the way. His mother was invalid most of his life and she passed away when he was 12 years old. Five years later his sister, Abbie, passed away when he was 17. His father, John Coolidge, lived a long while though, and Coolidge described his father with much detail. In fact, Coolidge refers to him as being very skilled in many crafts: such as working as a gifted carriage maker, careful stone mason, and a good buisness man. It was only later in life that
John became a politican became 

Calvin's fondest memories are going to the legislative hall where his father was working. 

It's quite funny, Calvin's grandfather had the same exact name as him but they had different aspirations. Calvin took after his father and his political aspirations.
