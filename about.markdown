    <div class="Intro"> Hey I'm Niyathi! I'm a rising senior, a Spirit of Ramanujan Talent Search Winner & World Science Scholar, interested in math & physics, particularly combinatorics and mechanics (check out my research!) I just attended PROMYS second year program this past summer, completed the year round PACT program, and currently research physics and math topics. I also participate in a lot of STEM competitions like USAMTS, AIME, Math League, etc. In my free time, you can catch me blogging, painting, or catching up on some YouTube videos.
