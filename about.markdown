    <div class="Intro"> Hey I'm Niyathi! I'm a rising senior, a Spirit of Ramanujan Awardee, interested in math & physics, particularly combinatorics and mechanics (check out my research!) I just attended PROMYS this past summer, finished the year round PACT program, started research & have been participating in Olympiads like AIME or f=ma since middle school. In my free time, you can catch me blogging, drawing, or catching up on some YouTube videos. Check out my <a href="https://niyathikukkapalli.com/research/">Research</a>, <a href="https://niyathikukkapalli.com/blog">Blog</a>, and <a href="https://niyathikukkapalli.com/art/">Art</a> pages for more about me!</div>
