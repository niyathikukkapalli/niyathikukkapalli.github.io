    <div class="Intro">Hey, I'm Niyathi and I'm currently a high school student. I
        enjoy studying math & physics and
        these days i'm interested in combinatorics and mechanics. I take part in various comeptitions and
        olympiads
        too, like AMC or f=ma. Outside of school, you might find me painting,
        binging Youtube, playing chess, or working on this wesbite (learning web development as I'm coding
        this).
        You can check out my <a href="/art.html">art</a>, <a href="/math.html">math</a>, or my <a
            href="/projects.html">projects/research</a>
        pages for more of my stuff.</div>
