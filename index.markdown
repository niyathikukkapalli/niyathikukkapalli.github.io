    <div class="Intro"> Hey I'm Niyathi! I'm a rising senior, profoundly interested in math & physics, particularly combinatorics and mechanics (check out my research!) I just attended PROMYS this past summer, just finished the Group 2 PACT program, and have started math and physics research since then & have been participating in Olympiads like AIME or f=ma. In my free time, you can catch me blogging, drawing, or catching up on some YouTube videos. Check out my <a href="https://niyathikukkapalli.com/research/">Research</a>, <a href="https://niyathikukkapalli.com/blog">Blog</a>, and <a href="https://niyathikukkapalli.com/art/">Art</a> pages for more about me!</div>
