        <div class="problem">
            <h4>Problem:</h4>
            $8$ rooks are randomly placed on different squares of a chessboard. A rook is said to attack all of the
            squares
            in its row and its column. Compute the probability that every square is occupied or attacked by at least $1$
            rook. You may leave unevaluated binomial coefficients in your answer.
        </div>

        <div class="solution">
            <h4>Solution:</h4>
            <p>Some observations to note are that... When all the rows and/or all the columns have a rook, then all the
                squares
                are attacked or occupied. So we can make this problem simpler and start off with counting the amount of
                ways
                to
                count the number of ways we can put rooks are in every row and/or column.</p>

            <p>So let's say we start off on the leftmost column. There are \(8\) places for this rook to go. Then we
                move
                onto the next column. There are still
                \(8\) places for this next rook to go, since we aren't caring about the rows in this case. </p>

            <p>So if we continue this pattern for every row, there are $8^8$ ways to arrange the rooks such that they
                cover
                every column. By similar
                reasoning, there are also \(8^8\) ways to arrange the rooks such that they cover every row. So so far we
                have $2
                \cdot 8^8$. But wait! We over counted! In both cases, we over counted where the rooks might be in both
                the
                rows
                and columns! Specifically, we counted that case twice! </p>

            <p>Since there are two cases, we cover all the rows or cover all the columns, we over count the case of
                having
                all the rows AND columns filled twice. We can use PIE or the
                Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion and subtract once, the cases where the rooks are in both the rows
                and
                columns. So if we start from the leftmost column, there are $8$ places to keep our rook. But now we
                don't
                want
                any of our rooks adjacent to each other, so there are $7$ spots in the next column for the next rook.
            </p>

            <p> Similarly,there are $6$ places in the $3$rd column for the $3$rd rook. Then there are $5$ places in the
                4th
                column for the
                $4$th rook. Continuing this pattern gets us a total of $8!$ ways to arrange the rooks. So we have...
                $$8^8 +
                8^8
                - 8! = 2(8^8) - 8! = 33514112.$$ This will serve as the numerator for our probability since it's the
                number
                of
                ways that every square on the board is attacked or occupied. </p>

            <p>Our denominator is simply the total ways that we
                can arrange the $8$ rooks in $64$ squares with no restrictions whatsoever. This will just be... $${64
                \choose
                8}.$$ </p>

            <p>Our answer follows as... $$\boxed{\frac{33514112}{{64 \choose 8}}}$$</p>
