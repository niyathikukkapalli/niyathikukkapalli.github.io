            <h4>Problem:</h4>
            Suppose we have a house (with finitely many rooms) in which every room has an even number of doors. Prove
            that the number of doors from the house to the outside world is also even.



        </div>

        <div class="solution">
            <h4>Solution:</h4>
            <p>There isn't too much information to work with but the problem does give us some important clues. For
                example, we can say that there are two main types of doors. The doors that connect to the outside and to
                one
                room and the doors that connect two rooms together. This is because if some rooms don't have a door that
                connects them, well, that can just be considered as one room!</p>

            <p>The problem states that there are a finite number of rooms, so let's say`that there are $n$ rooms. Each
                room
                also has a positive number of doors. To hopefully get us somewhere, we think to assign some variables.
                We
                can think of...</p>

            <p>$$r_i = \text{the total number of doors in room i }$$$$d_i = \text{the number of doors in room i that
                connect room i to another room}$$$$w_i = \text{the number of doors that connect room i to the outside
                world
                }$$
                Therefore, for all the $n$ rooms we can write...</p>

            <p>$$r_1 = d_1 + w_1 $$$$r_2 = d_2 + w_2$$$$...$$$$r_n = d_n + w_n $$
                Hmm... what do we do with all of these equations? For starters, we can try to add them all up! We
                obtain,
                $$(r_1 + r_2 +...+r_n) = (d_1 + d_2 +...+d_n) + (w_1 + w_2 +... +w_n).$$
                The first thing we notice right
                off
                the bat is that the left hand side is even! This is because, each room has an even number of doors, so
                when
                you add only even numbers together you get an even number (because you can factor off a 2 from each
                term).
            </p>
            <p>The term $(w_1 + w_2 +... +w_n)$ is the sum of all the doors in the house that lead to the outside world.
                We
                can just collectively name this $w$. This is because every door of this type is counted once and only
                once
                (no duplicates) so this is the exact sum of the doors from the house to the outside world.
                So far we have, $(r_1 + r_2 +...+r_n) = (d_1 + d_2 +...+d_n) + w. $
            </p>

            <p>Now let's work a little with $(d_1 + d_2 +...+d_n).$ This is the number of doors that connect $2$ rooms
                together in the house. How can we simplify this? Well, for starters, we can say that if we counted this
                type
                of door in one room, then it must be counted in another room as well. This is because this type of door
                connects TWO rooms together, so it'll be counted twice, once for each room it connects. Therefore, we
                suspect to get the actual number of doors that connect $2$ rooms we have to divide this quantity by $2.$
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, $(d_1 + d_2 +...+d_n) = 2d$ for some positive integer $d.$ We can substitute this into our
                original equation. Now, we have $(r_1 + r_2 +...+ r_n) = 2d + w.$ We are pretty much done now! If we
                rewrite
                the equation in English we have..</p>

            <p>$$\text{even number} - \text{another even number} = w. $$
                If we have the positive even integers, $2k$ and $2r$ such that $r < k$ and $r,k > 0.$ Then $2k - 2r$ is also
                    even because $2(k-r)$ has a factor of two.</p>

            <p>Therefore, $w$ is even and we have proved that the number of doors to the outside world is also even.
